 * \brief Helper class to be used to obtain lambda functions for the tensors
 *        involved in the laws that describe the different kind of fluxes that
 *        occur in DuMuX models (i.e. advective, diffusive and heat conduction fluxes).
 *        The local systems appearing in Mpfa methods have to be solved subject to
 *        the different tensors. This class returns lambda expressions to be used in the
 *        local systems. The specialization for other discretization methods allows
 *        compatibility with the TPFA scheme, which could be used for one or more of the tensors.
