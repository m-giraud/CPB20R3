 * \ingroup ConstraintSolvers
 * \brief Computes the composition of all phases of a N-phase,

 *        present
 *
 * The constraint solver assumes the following quantities to be set:
 *
 * - temperatures of *all* phases
 * - saturations of *all* phases
 * - pressures of *all* phases
 *
 * It also assumes that the mole/mass fractions of all phases sum up
 * to 1. After calling the solve() method the following quantities
 * are calculated in addition:
 *
 * - temperature of *all* phases
 * - density, molar density, molar volume of *all* phases
 * - composition in mole and mass fractions and molarities of *all* phases
 * - mean molar masses of *all* phases
 * - fugacity coefficients of *all* components in *all* phases
 * - if the setViscosity parameter is true, also dynamic viscosities of *all* phases
 * - if the setEnthalpy parameter is true, also specific enthalpies of *all* phases
